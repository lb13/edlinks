Title: Mysterium

In the ten thousand years of human development, has there arisen such a one as you? In this moment the unyielding fire of creation has reached its furious summit - how can any moment compare to your effulgence? In the treasurehouse of your heart there are the aching aeons, in the ground there is blood mixed with the soil. There can be no future without your present - you, here, are the foundation of everything that was and will be. You are the narrow way through which time must pass. Terrible and fearsome are your powers. Lost are those who neglect this!

At the set stone of Uruk there dwells the secret flame - and at the end of all things is the yawning void.
