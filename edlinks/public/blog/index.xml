      <description>Hello again!
The new site has been running for a few weeks now, and feedback has been good about the core concept and functionality.
Some users rightly pointed out that the design was too close to that used for official government services, and despite the disclaimers dotted around the site, was liable to cause confusion and mislead people.
This was certainly not my intention - rather I wanted to provide a seamless experience when navigating between different resources - but I can see that it was a little too close for comfort.</description>

      <description>Hello, this is a quick post to say hello!
After working in the field of education funding for several years, I have amassed a prodigious list of bookmarks - and every year the list grows as more resources are published, new organisations emerge, and new web services are developed.
It was becoming tricky to keep track of all these links, and trickier still to make them available to colleagues in a simple and straightforward way.</description>
