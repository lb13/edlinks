      <description>The National Skills Fund is a new funding option within the Adult Education Budget, which offers learners aged 19+ the opportunity to claim full funding for their first full level 3 qualification. Unlike the Level 3 Legal Entitlement, there is no upper age limit.
Only a targeted selection of qualifications fall into the NSF, these are aims that the ESFA believes will ‘&amp;hellip;help adults to train and gain the valuable skills they need to improve their job prospects.</description>

      <description>Oh boy, apprenticeship funding is confusing.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the basic idea, which I stole from the technical funding guide that the ESFA published.
The scenario Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine we have a 12 month apprenticeship with a funding cap of £12,000. That cap is there because the ESFA don&amp;rsquo;t think it should cost any more than that to deliver the apprenticeship.
The training provider agrees a TNP (Total Negotiated Price) of £15,000 with the employer because&amp;hellip; well sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s the way things go.</description>

      <description>There are a few different online services that you can use to search for qualifications, find out whether they are eligible for ESFA funding, and connect with awarding bodies.
One quick way to search for these from the front page of EducationFunding.UK is to type fqs - this is a shortcode for &amp;lsquo;find qualification services&amp;rsquo;.
Find a Learning Aim This is a new government service which you can use to search for qualifications via their name or aim reference - in addition you can also filter results by level and awarding body.</description>
